{"question": "What is an SR flip-flop?", "answer": "A Set-Reset flip-flop sets or resets output based on inputs.", "proof": "S=1, R=0 sets output to 1; S=0, R=1 resets output to 0.", "real_life_scenario": "Used in control circuits to store simple state conditions."}
{"question": "What is a JK flip-flop and how is it different from SR?", "answer": "JK flip-flop resolves the invalid state in SR flip-flop.", "proof": "When J=1, K=1, it toggles the output; no undefined state.", "real_life_scenario": "Used in counters and frequency dividers."}
{"question": "What is a register in digital electronics?", "answer": "A register is a group of flip-flops used to store multi-bit data.", "proof": "Each flip-flop holds one bit; multiple flip-flops store bytes or words.", "real_life_scenario": "Used in CPUs for temporary storage of instructions or data."}
