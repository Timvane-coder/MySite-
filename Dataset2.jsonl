{"question": "Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides → 3x = 15. Step 2: Divide by 3 → x = 5.", "proof": "Substituting x = 5 into the original equation: 3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20. Since both sides are equal, x = 5 is the correct solution."}
{"question": "Solve for y: 2y - 4 = 10", "answer": "Step 1: Add 4 to both sides → 2y = 14. Step 2: Divide by 2 → y = 7.", "proof": "Substituting y = 7 into the original equation: 2(7) - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10. Since both sides are equal, y = 7 is the correct solution."}
{"question": "Solve for z: 5z + 2 = 3z + 8", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 3z from both sides → 2z + 2 = 8. Step 2: Subtract 2 from both sides → 2z = 6. Step 3: Divide by 2 → z = 3.", "proof": "Substituting z = 3 into the original equation: 5(3) + 2 = 3(3) + 8 → 15 + 2 = 9 + 8 → 17 = 17. Since both sides are equal, z = 3 is the correct solution."
