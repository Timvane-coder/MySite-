{"question": "Solve for x: x² + 4x + 5 = 0", "answer": "Step 1: Identify coefficients: a = 1, b = 4, c = 5. Step 2: Compute discriminant: Δ = b² - 4ac = 16 - 20 = -4. Step 3: Since Δ < 0, roots are complex: x = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a = (-4 ± √(-4)) / 2 = (-4 ± 2i) / 2 = -2 ± i.", "proof": "Substitute x = -2 + i into the original equation: (-2 + i)² + 4(-2 + i) + 5 = 0.
