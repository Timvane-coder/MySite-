{"question": "Solve the system of equations: 6x - y = 7 and 2x + 3y = 1", "answer": "Step 1: Solve first for y: y = 6x - 7. Step 2: Substitute into second: 2x + 3(6x - 7) = 1 → 2x + 18x - 21 = 1 → 20x = 22 → x = 11/10. Step 3: y = 6(11/10) - 7 = 66/10 - 70/10 = -4/10 = -2/5.", "proof": "Check: 6(11/10) + 2/5 = 66/10 + 4/10 = 70/10 = 7; 2(11/10) + 3(-2/5) = 22/10 - 6/10 = 16/10 = 8/5. Oops! That doesn't match. Let's recheck."}
{"question": "Solve the system of equations: 4x + 3y = 24 and 2x - y = 4", "answer": "Step 1: Multiply second equation by 3: 6x - 3y = 12. Step 2: Add to first: (4x + 3y) + (6x - 3y) = 24 + 12 → 10x = 36 → x = 18/5. Step 3: Substitute: 2(18/5) - y = 4 → 36/5 - y = 4 → y = 36/5 - 20/5 = 16/5.", "proof": "Check: 4(18/5) + 3(16/5) = 72/5 + 48/5 = 120/5 = 24; 2(18/5) - 16/5 = 36/5 - 16/5 = 20/5 = 4. Correct."}
{"question": "Solve the system of equations: 7x - 2y = 5 and 3x + y = 8", "answer": "Step 1: Solve second for y: y = 8 - 3x. Step 2: Substitute into first: 7x - 2(8 - 3x) = 5 → 7x - 16 + 6x = 5 → 13x = 21 → x = 21/13. Step 3: y = 8 - 3(21/13) = 8 - 63/13 = (104 - 63)/13 = 41/13.", "proof": "Check: 7(21/13) - 2(41/13) = 147/13 - 82/13 = 65/13 = 5; 3(21/13) + 41/13 = 63/13 + 41/13 = 104/13 = 8. Correct."}
{"question": "Solve the system of equations: 2x + y = 5 and x - 3y = -4", "answer": "Step 1: Solve first for y: y = 5 - 2x. Step 2: Substitute into second: x - 3(5 - 2x) = -4 → x - 15 + 6x = -4 → 7x = 11 → x = 11/7. Step 3: y = 5 - 2(11/7) = 5 - 22/7 = 13/7.", "proof": "Check: 2(11/7) + 13/7 = 22/7 + 13/7 = 35/7 = 5; 11/7 - 3(13/7) = 11/7 - 39/7 = -28/7 = -4. Correct."}
