{"question": "What is a taxon?", "answer": "A group or level in a classification system.", "proof": "Each category such as species, genus, or family is called a taxon.", "real_life_scenario": "If a shelf in a store holds one category of items, what do biologists call each level of classification?"}
{"question": "What does the term 'phylogenetic tree' refer to?", "answer": "A diagram showing evolutionary relationships between species.", "proof": "It traces lineage and common ancestors based on traits and DNA.", "real_life_scenario": "If a family tree shows your relatives, what shows relationships among organisms?"}
{"question": "What is the basis for modern classification?", "answer": "Genetic and evolutionary relationships.", "proof": "DNA and molecular evidence now guide classification more than just physical traits.", "real_life_scenario": "If you use facial recognition and DNA to match relatives, what do scientists use for accurate classification?"}
{"question": "What is adaptation in biology?", "answer": "A feature that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment.", "proof": "Adaptations increase an organism’s chances of survival and reproduction.", "real_life_scenario": "If people wear warm clothes in cold places, what do animals develop to survive in such climates?"}
{"question": "Why are desert plants like cacti adapted to store water?", "answer": "Because they live in dry environments with little rainfall.", "proof": "Cacti have thick stems and spines to conserve water and reduce evaporation.", "real_life_scenario": "If you carry a water bottle during a long walk, what do desert plants use to survive dry conditions?"}
{"question": "How do polar bears stay warm in freezing temperatures?", "answer": "They have thick fur and a layer of fat (blubber).", "proof": "These adaptations insulate the body against cold.", "real_life_scenario": "If wearing a winter jacket keeps you warm, what natural clothing do polar bears have?"}
{"question": "What type of adaptation is camouflaging?", "answer": "Structural adaptation.", "proof": "Camouflage helps organisms blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators.", "real_life_scenario": "If a soldier wears camo to hide, what helps animals hide from predators?"}
{"question": "How do giraffes' long necks help them survive?", "answer": "They help giraffes reach leaves high in trees.", "proof": "This structural adaptation allows them to feed where other animals can’t.", "real_life_scenario": "If you use a ladder to reach a high shelf, what adaptation do giraffes have for the same purpose?"}
{"question": "What is behavioral adaptation?", "answer": "An action or behavior that helps an organism survive.", "proof": "Examples include migration, hibernation, and hunting techniques.", "real_life_scenario": "If people go indoors during a storm, what do birds do when seasons change?"}
{"question": "Why do some animals hibernate?", "answer": "To conserve energy during cold seasons when food is scarce.", "proof": "Hibernation slows down body processes to save energy.", "real_life_scenario": "If people save money during hard times, what do bears do to survive winter?"}
{"question": "What is physiological adaptation?", "answer": "A change in internal body function that helps survival.", "proof": "For example, desert animals produce concentrated urine to save water.", "real_life_scenario": "If a car engine adjusts to conserve fuel, how does a camel's body save water?"}
{"question": "How do aquatic animals like fish adapt to water environments?", "answer": "They have gills to extract oxygen and fins for swimming.", "proof": "These structures help them breathe and move in water.", "real_life_scenario": "If you wear flippers and an oxygen tank for diving, what built-in features do fish have?"}
{"question": "Can adaptations take place quickly?", "answer": "Usually, adaptations develop over many generations.", "proof": "They occur through natural selection over long periods of time.", "real_life_scenario": "If it takes years for technology to improve, how long do living things take to adapt to new environments?"}
