{"question": "What is phototropism?", "answer": "The growth of a plant in response to light direction.", "proof": "Plants bend toward the light to maximize photosynthesis.", "real_life_scenario": "If a person moves closer to a light source to see better, what is the plant’s version of this behavior?"}
{"question": "What is tropism in plants?", "answer": "Tropism is the directional growth response of a plant to an external stimulus.", "proof": "Examples include phototropism (light), geotropism (gravity), and hydrotropism (water).", "real_life_scenario": "If a sunflower turns toward sunlight during the day, what type of plant response is that?"}
{"question": "What is phototropism?", "answer": "Growth of a plant toward or away from light.", "proof": "Shoots generally grow toward light (positive phototropism).", "real_life_scenario": "If you move your chair closer to a window for sunlight, what similar behavior does a plant show?"}
{"question": "What is geotropism?", "answer": "Growth response of a plant to gravity.", "proof": "Roots grow downward (positive geotropism), shoots grow upward (negative geotropism).", "real_life_scenario": "If water always flows downward due to gravity, how do roots know which way to grow?"}
{"question": "What is hydrotropism?", "answer": "Growth response of roots toward a water source.", "proof": "Roots can detect moisture and grow in its direction.", "real_life_scenario": "If you dig underground and water flows toward dry soil, what plant process is similar?"}
{"question": "What are plant hormones?", "answer": "Chemical substances that regulate growth and development in plants.", "proof": "Examples include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.", "real_life_scenario": "If a manager gives instructions to workers, what do hormones do in plants?"}
