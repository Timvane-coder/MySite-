{"question": "Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides → 3x = 15. Step 2: Divide by 3 → x = 5."}
{"question": "Solve for x: 4x - 3 = 17", "answer": "Step 1: Add 3 to both sides → 4x = 20. Step 2: Divide by 4 → x = 5."}
{"question": "Solve for x: 2x + 6 = 10", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 6 from both sides → 2x = 4. Step 2: Divide by 2 → x = 2."}
{"question": "Solve for x: 5x - 10 = 40", "answer": "Step 1: Add 10 to both sides → 5x = 50. Step 2: Divide by 5 → x = 10."}
{"question": "Solve for x: 6x + 2 = 14", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 2 from both sides → 6x = 12. Step 2: Divide by 6 → x = 2."}
