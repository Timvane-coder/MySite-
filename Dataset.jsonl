{"question": "Find the area of a rectangle with vertices at (1, 1), (1, 5), (4, 5), and (4, 1).", "answer": "Length = 4 - 1 = 3 units, Width = 5 - 1 = 4 units. Area = length × width = 3 × 4 = 12 square units.", "proof": "Using the coordinates, the opposite sides are parallel and equal. So it forms a rectangle. Area = base × height = 3 × 4 = 12.", "real_life_scenario": "You are designing a garden in a rectangular space with coordinates as corners. How much land area do you need to cover?"}
{"question": "Find the area of a parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (4, 0), (5, 3), and (1, 3).", "answer": "Base = 4 units, Height = 3 units. Area = base × height = 4 × 3 = 12 square units.", "proof": "The height is the vertical distance between the parallel sides. Base from (0, 0) to (4, 0) = 4 units, height = 3 units from 0 to 3. Area = 4 × 3 = 12.", "real_life_scenario": "You are creating a tile design in the shape of a parallelogram. How many square units of tile do you need?"}
{"question": "Find the area of a square with vertices at (2, 2), (2, 6), (6, 6), and (6, 2).", "answer": "Side = 6 - 2 = 4 units. Area = side² = 4² = 16 square units.", "proof": "All sides are equal and angles are 90°, forming a square. Side length from (2, 2) to (6, 2) = 4 units. Area = 4² = 16.", "real_life_scenario": "You are painting a square floor plan defined by these coordinates. How much area will you paint?"}
{"question": "Find the area of a trapezoid with vertices at (1, 1), (5, 1), (4, 4), and (2, 4).", "answer": "Bases = 4 units each, Height = 3 units. Area = 1/2 × (base1 + base2) × height = 1/2 × (4 + 2) × 3 = 9 square units.", "proof": "The two horizontal sides (length 4 and 2) are bases, and the height is the vertical distance between them (4 - 1 = 3).", "real_life_scenario": "You're designing a garden bed shaped like a trapezoid. How many square units of soil do you need?"}
{"question": "Find the area of a rhombus with diagonals joining points (1, 2) to (5, 6) and (1, 6) to (5, 2).", "answer": "Length of diagonal 1 = 5.66, diagonal 2 = 5.66. Area = 1/2 × d1 × d2 = 1/2 × 5.66 × 5.66 ≈ 16 square units.", "proof": "Diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. Use distance formula to compute diagonals. Area = 1/2 × d1 × d2.", "real_life_scenario": "A park section is shaped like a rhombus with measured diagonals. How much land area does it cover?"}
