{"question": "Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides → 3x = 15. Step 2: Divide by 3 → x = 5.", "proof": "Substituting x = 5 into the original equation: 3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20. Since both sides are equal, x = 5 is the correct solution.", "real_life_scenario": "You spend $5 on a pen and want to buy some notebooks that cost $3 each.

{"question": "Solve for z: 5z + 2 = 3z + 8", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 3z from both sides → 2z + 2 = 8. Step 2: Subtract 2 from both sides → 2z = 6. Step 3: Divide by 2 → z = 3.", "proof": "Substituting z = 3 into the original equation: 5(3) + 2 = 3(3) + 8 → 15 + 2 = 9 + 8 → 17 = 17. Since both sides are equal, z = 3 is the correct solution.", "real_life_scenario": "You and your friend are saving money. You saved $5 per week plus $2 extra, and your friend saved $3 per week plus $8 extra. After some weeks, you both have the same amount. How many weeks did it take?"}
{"question": "Solve for x: x² + 4x + 5 = 0", "answer": "Step 1: Identify coefficients: a = 1, b = 4, c = 5. Step 2: Compute discriminant: Δ = b² - 4ac = 16 - 20 = -4. Step 3: Since Δ < 0, roots are complex: x = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a = (-4 ± √(-4)) / 2 = (-4 ± 2i) / 2 = -2 ± i.", "proof": "Substitute x = -2 + i into the original equation: (-2 + i)² + 4(-2 + i) + 5 = 0. Simplifying: 4 - 4i + i² - 8 + 4i + 5 = 0. Since i² = -1, we have 4 - 4i - 1 - 8 + 4i + 5 = 0, confirming x = -2 + i is a solution. Similarly, for x = -2 - i: (-2 - i)² + 4(-2 - i) + 5 = 0. Simplifying: 4 + 4i + i² - 8 - 4i + 5 = 0. Again, i² = -1, so 4 + 4i - 1 - 8 - 4i + 5 = 0, confirming x = -2 - i is also a solution.", "real_life_scenario": "You're designing a curved arch for a garden and using a quadratic formula to determine the height. The equation has no real roots, meaning the arch doesn't touch the ground—it just floats above, a concept often used in architecture and design analysis."}
{"question": "Solve for x: 4x - 6 = 10", "answer": "Step 1: Add 6 to both sides → 4x = 16. Step 2: Divide by 4 → x = 4.", "proof": "Substituting x = 4 into the original equation: 4(4) - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10. Since both sides are equal, x = 4 is the correct solution.", "real_life_scenario": "You earn $4 per hour and have a $6 debt. If you want to end up with $10, how many hours do you need to work?"}
{"question": "Solve for y: 6y + 9 = 3", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 9 from both sides → 6y = -6. Step 2: Divide by 6 → y = -1.", "proof": "Substituting y = -1 into the original equation: 6(-1) + 9 = -6 + 9 = 3. Since both sides are equal, y = -1 is the correct solution.", "real_life_scenario": "You borrowed money and paid back $6 for each installment, plus an extra $9 fee. If you’ve paid $3 in total so far, how many installments have you made?"}
{"question": "Solve for z: 7z - 14 = 0", "answer": "Step 1: Add 14 to both sides → 7z = 14. Step 2: Divide by 7 → z = 2.", "proof": "Substituting z = 2 into the original equation: 7(2) - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0. Since both sides are equal, z = 2 is the correct solution.", "real_life_scenario": "A delivery service charges $7 per package minus a $14 discount for bulk orders. If your bill is $0, how many packages did you ship?"}
{"question": "Solve for a: 2a + 3 = 2a - 5", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 2a from both sides → 3 = -5. Step 2: Since this is false, there is no solution.", "proof": "There is no value of a that can make 2a + 3 equal to 2a - 5. The equation is inconsistent.", "real_life_scenario": "Two friends are comparing their savings plans, both adding the same amount each week, but starting from different points. One starts with $3 more, the other with $5 less. Since their weekly contributions are equal, their balances will never match."}
{"question": "Solve for m: 9 - 3m = 0", "answer": "Step 1: Subtract 9 from both sides → -3m = -9. Step 2: Divide by -3 → m = 3.", "proof": "Substituting m = 3 into the original equation: 9 - 3(3) = 9 - 9 = 0.
