{"question": "In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, two prisoners can either 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'. If both cooperate, they get 2 years in prison each. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector goes free and the cooperator gets 5 years. If both defect, they each get 4 years. What is the Nash equilibrium strategy?", "answer": "Step 1: Consider each player’s best response. If one cooperates, the other minimizes prison time by defecting (0 years instead of 2). If one defects, the other does best by also defecting (4 years instead of 5). Step 2: Since defecting is always the best response, both players defect in equilibrium.
